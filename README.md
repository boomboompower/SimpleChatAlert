Whats it for | New features 
------------ | -------------
What we think is one of the best uses for this plugin is, Alerting players if you are holding an event, e.g: _/alert We are holding a drop party at spawn!_ would become: ALERT: We are holding a drop party at spawn! This is a clear message in the chat which people will be able to see easily. | All features including Chat, ActionBars, Titles, PlayerList header/footer alerts are now 110% built in! No un-needed dependancies!
